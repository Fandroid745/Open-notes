# 📝 Notes App

A modern, lightweight Notes application built using **Jetpack Compose** and following **MVVM + Clean Architecture** principles. Designed to be scalable, maintainable, and fully reactive.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### 🎯 Architecture

* **MVVM (Model - View - ViewModel)**
  Separates UI (View), business logic (ViewModel), and data (Model) for cleaner, testable code.

* **Clean Architecture**
  Further decouples the code into layers (UI, Domain, Data), promoting scalability and easier testing.

### 🛠️ Core Technologies

* **Kotlin**
  A modern, concise, and safe programming language for Android development.

* **Jetpack Compose**
  Declarative UI toolkit from Google. Simplifies UI development and minimizes memory leaks and crashes.

* **Room**
  Persistence library for local data storage using SQLite with Kotlin support.

* **Navigation Component**
  Manages app navigation with ease, including passing data between screens and back stack handling.

* **Dagger Hilt**
  Simplifies dependency injection with lifecycle-aware components.

* **Kotlin Coroutines**
  Asynchronous programming simplified — for background operations like DB access or I/O.

* **Kotlin Flow**
  A reactive stream to observe data changes and emit results from the domain/data layers.
